# TIPE_17_18

This code was made for a TIPE (Travaux d'Initiative Personnelle Encadr√©e) back in 2017-2018. 
Its main goal is to represent the reflectivity of a Bragg mirror with multiple parameters:
- The number of layers
- the thickness of the different layers
- Impurities

I may update this repository once I find back a few images to illustrate this page with some results.
